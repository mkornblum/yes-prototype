## HCD Prototype

This is a quick prototype for the Substantial Submarines Fall 2014
Human Centered Design class.

## How do I use it?

1. Clone the repo
2. open `index.html` in your favorite web browser

## How do I dev on it?
1. Clone the repo
2. `npm install`
3. `./node_modules/browser-sync/bin/browser-sync start --server
   --files "css/*.css, *.html"` (or however you want to start browser
   sync, if you have a .envrc or something that is probably a better path)
