          <h3>The New York Times Profiles YES!</h3>
          <p>Students, Families and Schools say YES!<br>
            by Helen Selway<br>
            Published: December 11, 2016</p>

          <p>Two years ago, Quinn Dearborn started her junior year of high
            school with the usual mix of excitement and nervousness about what
            role the next couple of years would play in shaping her future,
            especially as the pressure of “what’s next” gained steam. Because
            community service credits are a big part of the experience of MLK
            High, she was empowered with a opportunity through her school’s
            participation in the national YES! (Youth Entrepreneurs for Social
            !mpact) program to channel her raw passion into real
            results.</p>

          <p>With an instructional strategy and toolkit that students,
            families or schools can utilize for making social impact, YES!
            participants are able to meet academic standards by
            participating in an organized service project of their own
            making that addresses community needs and fosters civic
            responsibility. YES! leverages existing incentive structures,
            existing requirements and resources to make it happen.</p>

          <p>“It made me feel confident about making a difference with
            what I was already interested in and helped me turn my ideas
            it into action,” Dearborn says. “I loved spending elective
            class time on something I can see now helped me in my
            longer-term career”. Through the program, she took her love of
            bass music, soundsystems and automotives to start a service
            for repurposing sound systems parts called GoBoom. GoBoom
            educates and employs local youth in refurbishing, recycling
            and reselling audio parts for cars - which has turned into a
            profitable ongoing business.</p>

          <p>YES! initially launched in the Seattle area, then grew city
            by city across the US to help build upon existing community
            service requirements to help get students to move beyond the
            initial idea phase into a real-life experience of implementing
            a service or product.  “We saw lots of opportunities out there
            for supporting youth who are already interested in learning
            about social entrepreneurship, but we wanted to increase the
            pool that are able to participate and learn from such an
            experience,” said Zach Smith, co-founder of the program.</p>

          <p>Integrating with schools was the missing link that YES! was
            able to innovate on. Through an extensive research phase, they
            found many young people with varying levels of exposure to
            entrepreneurial experiences still found it challenging to
            balance the demands of school. “Connecting service learning to
            your community through your school were the dots that we saw
            that needed to be connected”, Smith says. </p>

          <p>“The refreshing part of how YES! changed the conversation,
            is that schools never really used to ask kids “What are you passionate
            about?  How will you use that to create change?” says Willie Mack,
            principal of MLK, “Having students leverage their own personal
            experience and passion is key to success.”</p>

          <p>YES! also uses the funds from the purchases of the extended
            school curriculum to host a national pitch event where
            organizations created by YES! students can compete for
            funding. “It’s a great way to build momentum, get extra
            exposure and excitement around the amazing ideas that this
            generation is making happen” says Mack.</p>
